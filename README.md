# Best Bet

This repository contains the code for a Flask-based web application that implements a neural network built from scratch in Python. The model is trained on historical data from the Brazilian football championship to generate predictions and identify optimal betting opportunities for upcoming matches.

The application supports caching of the neural networkâ€™s parameters after each training session and allows users to retrain the model using different hyperparameters for further experimentation and optimization.
