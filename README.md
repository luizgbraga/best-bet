# Best Bet
## Introduction
Football in Brazil has assumed a role that goes beyond a simple sporting modality, becoming a social phenomenon. Historically, it is possible to perceive it from two perspectives: as a means of ideological transmission and as an important element of Brazilian culture.
Thus, football has become much more than a sport or leisure, it has become a space where society symbolically expresses itself, manifests itself, allowing itself to be discovered.

Sports betting has become a consolidated activity that grows 11.5% every year. In 2020, the global market was valued at US$59.6 billion - and could reach up to US$127.3 billion in 2027. In Brazil, the numbers are also encouraging. With the regulation of sports betting, the country could become one of the main markets in the world, taking into account the size of the population and the Brazilian people's passion for sports.

In an environment where football is very relevant and sports betting is increasing, the presence of a well-trained platform to predict match results becomes important.

Therefore, we set out to create a flask app that uses big data and machine learning to determine the best bets in Brasileir√£o matches
